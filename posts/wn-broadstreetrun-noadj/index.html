<p>Jenny waited for the train to Olney Station.<br>
She wore sneakers, tights, and a trash bag.<br>
Some people on the train also wore sneakers and tights.<br>
Other people wore shorts.<br>
“Are you Neta’s Mom? I thought so! Patrick is in her class. I was in your house, once.”<br>
People looked at their watches.<br>
“When the train arrives, start running,” someone said.<br>
After 10 minutes, the train restarted.<br>
“Yay,” the crowd groaned.<br>
Balloons spelled “BROAD STREET RUN” on the Olney platform.<br>
Jenny followed the crowd to the corral.<br>
It was not yet raining.<br>
The Rocky Theme song played from a loudspeaker.<br>
Jenny danced briefly.<br>
The crowd started to run, so Jenny started to run.<br>
Some neighborhood residents cheered and watched from their porches.<br>
Some DJs and Emcees set up booths along the way.<br>
“I like them shoes!”<br>
After 2 miles, it started to rain.<br>
It rained for 8 miles.<br>
Jenny glanced down only to avoid puddles.<br>
Her concentration broke when hearing the Temple University marching band.<br>
It rained on the band.<br>
Her concentration broke again when hearing “You Can Call Me Al” on Church speakers.<br>
It rained on the Church members.<br>
A neighbor held a big sign: “Slap this sign if you have to poop”.<br>
Jenny slapped the sign, but did not have to poop.<br>
“If my concentration is broken for these reasons, I can’t be mad,” she smiled.<br>
At mile 9, Jenny thought, “You are nothing if not a strong finisher” and sped up.</p>

<p>Every month my writing group convenes for 90 minutes. 30 mins of shooting the breeze, 30 mins of creative writing, and 30 minutes of sharing. This is the unedited result.</p>
