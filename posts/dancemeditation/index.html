    <blockquote>
<p>I wrote this poem for the Heritage Dance Project with Group Motion Dance Company in late 2020. At that time, as for many, I felt broken. My body, my identity, creativity, all felt so foreign to me. I struggled with the project's prompt to explore my heritage through dance, song, and text. Still, with encouragement, I forced myself to try. To attempt moving and expressing again, and see what happened. Within those awkward attempts, I found some simple truths I could write about honestly: how dancing/moving feels to me and how the process of doing improv dancing had wider wisdom and questions for me. 3 years later, I find the strong visuals in this text force me into breath and movement as I read it. I hope it can help you find the same.</p>

<p>When I shut off the mind voice,<br>
the devil,<br>
the angel on my shoulders,<br>
the worried idle prattle,<br>
I breathe into my body.<br>
Feel the cool air flow into my nasal cavity,<br>
slide down and warm into my lungs.</p>
<p>Breathe out.</p>
<p>I picture the air radiate outward into my lowering shoulders,<!--more--><br>
through my biceps,<br>
down my sinewy forearms,<br>
and finally swirl into my fingertips.<br>
My wrists flick.<br>
I am an empty cavity and playground for the breath's path,<br>
finding its way like slow pinball to my extremities.</p>
<p>My body is moving with.<br>
The movement of air is energy,<br>
and it is generous.<br>
I breathe in slowly,<br>
my scapula sink<br>
into a stretch that it feels tense<br>
but welcome.<br>
Untensing, I breathe again,<br>
the feet steeled to the ground,<br>
and the knees find some bend.</p>
<p>I am dancing.<br>
A dance of listening and spontaneity.<br>
Of no purpose.<br>
No agenda.<br>
A slow dance that finds aches and tension in hiding and brings them an oxygenated massage.</p>
<p>It costs only a willingness to be open,<br>
listen and respond.<br>
To hold discomfort.</p>
<p>For in the process, the muscles will stretch and perhaps they will tear.<br>
But the body is built for this ritual.<br>
It will sew new strength between the muscle fibers,<br>
building new bends and new possibilities.<br>
Prepare you for the next.</p>
<p>How are you filtering out the noise and building your strength?<br>
How are you inviting discomfort and healing it?<br>
How are you listening?<br>
How will you respond?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you endlessly to my late and great dance mentor Manfred Fischbeck for seeing and encouraging the creativity in me, even from his hospital bed. This was/is by some magic a self-regenerating gift.</p>
