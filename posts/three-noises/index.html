<p>Prompt: Write a story that includes 3 sounds I hear around me</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kkkkk...kkk...kkk...</em> 2 weeks away. Week over week, the familiar static had become a pavlov's bell for a little snooze as she lay heavy and horizontal. Today, though, sleep was chased just out of reach by a spike of anxiety.</p>
<p>"Aww. Look at her little toes." Sure enough, all 5 on each foot: a relief for her dark imagination. <em>Kkk...kkk...clang!</em> She flinched. The sticky wand just slipped from the doctor's hand onto the metal cart.</p>
<p>"Well, everything looks great Hannah. That's it. Your last checkup before delivery. If you have no further questions, I'll leave you to get dressed and wish you luck!" After a few exchanged thanks, the door clicked close. Hannah and her forever companion together, alone.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wrote this short story on the back of a receipt in a bustling bar with a record player. It was inspired by an extended family member that was due any day.</p>
